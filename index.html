                    <h1>RESEARCH</h1>

                    <h2>Studied Market Trends</h2>

                    <p>While conducting research of <a href="img/casestudy.jpg" target="_blank">like minded
                            products</a>, I found the market is plentiful
                        with craft
                        kits and online art classes. Yet I didn’t find exactly what I was looking for. I have way too
                        many untouched DIY projects because I don’t have the right tools or
                        lack the accountability of having a live class experience. </p>
                    <p>Demand for creative projects only intensified as the pandemic forced people to stay home. With
                        the
                        lifting of restrictions, live events sold out quickly, as people were starving for connection.

                        With a renewed focus on creative skills, online learning company Skillshare reported 2020 as a
                        year of rapid growth — even before the pandemic — raising $66M.</p>
                    <p>By Using tools like <a href="img/swotanalysis.jpg" target="_blank">SWOT analysis</a> and <a
                            href="img/perceptualmap.jpg" target="_blank"> Perceptual Map</a>
                        , I was able to
                        gauge market opportunity
                        and determine what makes my project different.
                        The Who Made Who art kits are designed and curated to contain everything needed to boost your
                        creativity and learn a new creative hobby.</p>


                    <h1>Key findings from Adobe’s State of Creativity study</h1>
                    <p>&emsp; &#x2022; Global respondents believe being creative is valuable to society (70%)
                        and the economy (64%).<br>
                        &emsp; &#x2022; Only 1 in 4 report they are living up to their creative potential.<br>
                        &emsp; &#x2022; 68% says creativity is something you are born with <br>
                        &emsp; &#x2022; Only 41% percent describe themselves as creative<br>
                        &emsp; &#x2022; 78% wish they had more creative ability<br>
                    </p>

                    <p>Creativity is not magic. Creativity is a skill that can be learned by anyone.
                        The act of creation can reduce stress and anxiety and improve your mood. Creating can become a
                        form of self-care, not unlike a pedicure
                        or a massage. The goal is to develop a creative product that also taps into the mind+body
                        connection.</p>

                    <h1>PROCESS</h1>
                    <h2>DESIGN WITH FEEDBACK</h2>

                    <p>As I worked through the courses in the MAGWD program, I expounded on and implemented new
                        components to the art kits. I started the design process with a <a
                            href="img/WMW_LOGO_blkonWHITE.jpg" target="_blank">logo refresh</a>, replacing the <a
                            href="img/wmwlogo.jpg" target="_blank">owl mascot</a> with whimsical lettering and a retro
                        vibe. Moodboards were
                        established for the <a href="img/moodboardbox.jpg" target="_blank">packaging</a>
                        design and overall <a href="img/moodboardwmw.jpg" target="_blank">brand</a>. Each project was
                        broken down to four simple steps. The final printed
                        directions include creativity boosts, helpful tips, and link to informational videos.
                    </p>
                    <div class="page-hero__medium">
                        <img src="img/enjoytheprocess.jpg" alt="custom art kits" />
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Once the physical art kits were developed and screen printed, I used javascript to create a
                        <a href="https://aflattum.studio.mcad.edu/pftw/final/#/" target="_blank">prototype
                            website </a>for the art kits. I used Figma and XD to create an <a
                            href=" https://xd.adobe.com/view/d5a18603-c2da-4d32-b35f-fbceb0d69fbb-80f2/?fullscreen"
                            target="_blank">app prototpye</a> to further
                        expand on the web design. I ran user and beta testing to verify user journey and task flows.
                        <a href="img/userfeedbackux.jpg" target="_blank">User dialogue</a> helped identify an issue with
                        the design. Additional user feedback was utilized
                        throughout the
                        process to update the project with thoughtful refinements.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        Finally, I examined how the art kits can help people who don’t feel they are living up to their
                        creative potential. Through teaching workshops and researching creativity, I was able to develop
                        scientifically based creativity tips and an easy ritual intended to support the creative
                        process. The <a href="img/creativity_tips_mockup.jpg" target="_blank">creativity tips</a> and <a
                            href="img/easyrituals_mockup.jpg" target="_blank">easy ritual</a> are now included in
                        addition to the basic
                        art kit instructions. Inspired by the creativity research, I created an informational video - <a
                            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T63_g43ni8Y" target="_blank">“A
                            Guide to
                            Boost Creativity.”

                    <p>
                        The act of creation can
                        reduce stress and improve
                        mood. Practice making art
                        as a healthy habit, like
                        eating well and exercise.
                        Just 10 minutes of art each
                        day can be a magical
                        balm for yourself and the
                        world around you. </p>

                    <p>&#x2022; Teaching workshops with the art kits </p>

                    <p>I am excited to partner with Unglued Market for a series of in-person workshops in their new
                        maker space Craftorium. The art kits were inspired in part by the workshops I have taught with
                        Unglued since 2015. My hope is the art kits can leads to deeper bonds with current patrons and
                        potential new connections for future sales or commissions.</p>

                    <p>&#x2022; Connecting with local non-profit</p>
                    <p>Art to Change the World, a local non-profit, was contracted to create Maker Space (art rooms) in
                        transformational housing for women who have experienced homelessness. With this secondary
                        audience in mind, I was able to approach this project from a new angle and make it a more
                        holistic project than just a tutorial craft. Residents could learn a new skill and enjoy the
                        creative process. </p>
